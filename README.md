Two categories of css measurement
absolute unit and relative unit. Absolute unit are unit that are fixed, they are not affected by screen size or resolution, it cannot be bent. Once an element is defined. For examples of absolutes are "px", "centimeter", "millimeter", "inches", "point", e.t.c. It is not advisable to use "px" when doing for responsive design because it will give lot of problem when you want to manipulate into a smaller screen.
Desktop first approach and mobile first approach.
Bootstrap is a component based css, you input the component you want and it styles it for you and makes it responsive to your screen size, the only modifications bootstraps needs is the color.
Relative Unit are scaled based on the size of an element or the setting you have given to it. Examples include: "em-relative to the font size of the parent container", "rem- is relative to the font size of the root html element". "%- is used to define some kind of things like parent elements such as: images". For rel unit, the defined unit given to the parent element overrides the child element, but when a child element is given a unit, it is divided by the parent element (there are some calculations involved). Viewport is added on html, on meta background.
Don't mix units i.e do not use px, rem. em in one code.


RESPONSIVE DESIGN
This is an approach to web development that  ensure a website layout and content adapt to various screen size and devices including desktop, tablets and smartphone rather than creating multiple versions of the site for each device. It allows you use one design to work across all devices or screen sizes seamlessly or across all platforms seamlessly.
Core principles of responsive design:
1. Flexible,fluid layout (flex box ,or grid layout).
2. Flexible images; images should scale within the grid and not overflow.
3. Media query allows one to write specific styles for particular screen. Conditions to target when writing media query include; width, height, orientation (row/column), font-sizes. Users should be able to access your website at any point in time.
Common screen sizes we have: small, large, tablets, small laptops and desktops. 
Mobile phone- 320px-480px
Tablet-481px- 768px
Small laptops- 769px-1024px
Desktops- 1025px- above

Approaches to web design 
-Desktop approach
-Mobile approach
 The mobile first approach is the best way to start your design, i.e building for mobile screen first before any other one, but one can really start with anyone.
